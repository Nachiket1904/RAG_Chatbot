# RAG QA Bot with OpenAI and ChromaDB

This project integrates a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to build a sophisticated Question Answering (QA) Bot. It combines the capabilities of OpenAI's language models with ChromaDB for efficient data retrieval, offering insightful and contextually relevant answers to various queries.

## Project Description

The RAG QA Bot is designed to fetch pertinent information from a structured dataset using ChromaDB and then leverage the advanced language processing power of OpenAI's models to generate accurate and relevant answers. This project specifically demonstrates the bot's capabilities using a dataset related to the Bhagavad Gita.
